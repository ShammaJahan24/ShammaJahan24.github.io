       <h1><i>The Reason Why I Chose CSE...</i></h1>
       <p>Today's world is the world of technology.
         The contribution of science is behind everything 
         that is being discovered in this world. 
         This end of computer science is a lot.
         Through this our creativity develops by solving 
         various problems. It also contributes 
         to jobs. Because there is a demand for 
         different software developers around 
         the world. I want to be a software developer.
         You can even apply for a job on 
         Google by reading cse if you have good skills.I choose UIU for studying cse 
         because the best thing about UIU is the number of additional opportunities available over here.
         Student gets different ways to go abroad for study, research, opportunities to participate in 
         different national and international competition, opportunities to concern with many clubs along
         with social activities and a beautiful smoke free campus.
